## Requesting data
Qualified researchers can access the above deidentified input files for research purposes. Requests for the above files or for Arivale data should be sent to data-access@isbscience.org.  
  
Independent TwinsUK datasets used in this study were provided by the Department of Twin Research & Genetic Epidemiology (Kingâ€™s College London) after the approval of our Data Access Application (project number E1199). Requests for TwinsUK should be referred to their website (http://twinsuk.ac.uk/resources-for-researchers/access-our-data/).

## Software requirements
The following packages/libraries were used in Python (v 3.9.7) and R (v 4.1.1) in Jupyter Notebook to run the scripts:
* statsmodels
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scipy
* seaborn
* tidyverse
* readxl
* circlize
* RColorBrewer
* colorspace
